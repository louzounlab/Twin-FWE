            Welcome to the Pretwin Screen Project Biometry Calculator. This data is from a
            multinational, multicentred prospective study involving 527 twin pregnancies without
            major malformations and low-risk, non-invasive prenatal screening. The study was
            presented at the 21st World Congress of the Fetal Medicine Foundation in Lisbon,
            Portugal, in June 2024.</p>

            Please note the following information: chorionicity, gestational age in weeks and days,
            and estimated fetal weight for each twin. After that, press submit.
            <br>
            Discordance between the fetuses will be calculated using the following equation: (larger
            twin weight - smaller twin weight) / larger twin weight Ã— 100. A discordance of 20% or
            greater should be discussed with a fetal medicine expert and prompt more

            <br>
            By entering multiple gestational ages and fetal weight estimates, you can create a
            growth curve for both fetuses.
