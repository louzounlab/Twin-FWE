        <p>Welcome to the Pretwin Screen Project Biometry Calculator. This data is from a
            multinational, multicentred prospective study involving 527 twin pregnancies without
            major malformations and normal non-invasive prenatal screening. The study was
            presented at the 21st World Congress of the Fetal Medicine Foundation in Lisbon,
            Portugal in June 2024.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please make sure to note down the following information: chorionicity, gestational age in
            weeks and days, and estimated fetal weight for both twins. After that, press submit. By
            entering multiple gestational ages and fetal weight estimates, you&#39;ll be able to create a
            growth curve for both fetuses.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is imperative to verify all calculations before use. The estimated results cannot and
            should not replace clinical judgment. The creators of the Pretwin Screen Project, as well
            as any other individuals, organizations, or parties involved in the preparation or
            publication of this website, shall not be liable for any special or consequential damages
            resulting, in whole or in part, from the use of or reliance upon the results or values
